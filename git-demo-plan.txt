Git

Why
    - to avoid stack-final.c, stack-final-final.c, stack-final-final-v2.c and similar naming hell
    - to have the possibility to try separate implementations (branching)
    - to be able to track and compare what changed, including going 'back in time'
    - to start putting up your coding resume in a hosted repo (e.g. GitHub)
    - because you'll use it at work

Today
    - init a repo
    - commit and push, avoiding unwanted files
    - branch out
    - merge changes with a merge request
    - brief intro on rewriting history (amends, rebases)
